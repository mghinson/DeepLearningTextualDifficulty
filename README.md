# DeepLearningTextualDifficulty

This work is the result of a semester of independent work for Princeton's Computer Science department, where I attempt to harness the Paragraph2Vec algorithm (developed by Radim Rehurek) to classify books based on textual difficulty. My dataset consisted of childre's and more advanced literature frmo the middle to late 19th century. In this work, "children's literature" is defined as coming from Project Gutenberg's "Children's Literature" section, while "advanced literature" is literature coming from all fiction sections outside of this section.
